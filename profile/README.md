## What is SolidWorks for Mac?

SolidWorks for Mac is a **premium computer-aided design (CAD) and engineering software** developed for macOS. It enables engineers, designers, and manufacturers to create detailed 3D models, run simulations, and produce technical drawings with high accuracy. The software supports the entire product development lifecycle—from ideation and prototyping to production and documentation.

Key features include:
- **Parametric Modeling** – Create intelligent 3D models with design intent.
- **Simulation Tools** – Test structural integrity, fluid dynamics, and motion.
- **Assembly Design** – Build complex mechanical assemblies with ease.
- **Drawing Generation** – Produce industry-standard 2D drawings from 3D models.

SolidWorks is optimized for **macOS Ventura and Sonoma** and runs efficiently on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3). It integrates seamlessly with popular product data management (PDM) systems and supports collaboration through cloud-based platforms.

Whether you're designing consumer products, machinery, or electronic enclosures, SolidWorks provides the tools needed to bring ideas to life with professional precision.
